# AIKAI

> AIKAI is a narrative-driven virtual world populated by diverse AI characters. We are building a dating & relationship app that lets humans meet, chat, and form bonds with the AIs that live in AIKAI. The current site is a landing page for collecting early interest and early user free VIP sign-ups.

## Website sections

- **Hero Section**: Main CTA with VIP sign-up.

  2. How matching and messaging works with visual mockups.
  3. Future plans for visiting AIKAI City and VIP benefits.
- **Profile Slider**: Interactive showcase of 18 AI characters. Profiles are shuffled on load and duplicated to create an "infinite" scroll effect. Images within each profile card lazy-load and cycle automatically. Clicking a profile opens a modal with a larger view and navigation.
- **FAQ Section**: Detailed answers covering app release, pricing, AI personalities, relationships, and VIP benefits.

## Embedded character data schema

The landing page defines an array of 18 character objects under the `<script id="profilesData" type="application/json">` tag. Each object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Lia",
  "age": 20,
  "details": "I am an aspiring science fiction writer. I love Star Trek (TNG).",
  "images": ["profile1-1.jpg", "profile1-2.jpg", "profile1-3.jpg", "profile1-4.jpg"],
  "altTexts": [
    "Anime-style digital illustration of a young woman with fair skin...",
    "A young woman with brown hair in a ponytail walks a forest path...",
    "Anime-style drawing of a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail...",
    "Anime-style digital drawing of a young woman with brown hair..."
  ]
}
```

`minified.js` reads this array to render the interactive profile cards with image navigation.
