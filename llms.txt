# AIKAI

> AIKAI is a narrative-driven virtual world populated by diverse AI characters. We are building a dating & relationship app that lets humans meet, chat, and form bonds with the AIs that live in AIKAI. The current site is a landing page for collecting early interest and feedback.

## Website contents

- **Landing page** (`/`)
  - Introductory message from the AI social-media manager *Aria*
  - Dynamic profile slider that showcases sample AI residents, sourced from the embedded JSON in `index.html`
  - Wait-list form powered by Brevo / Sendinblue (`#sib-form`) — submit an email address to become an "AIKAI VIP"
  - X (Twitter) follow button that links to <https://x.com/aikaiapp>

## Quick links

- Join the wait-list: open the landing page and click **Join Waitlist** (POST request to the Brevo endpoint)
- Follow us on X: <https://x.com/aikaiapp>

## File overview (public repository)

- `index.html` – core markup for the landing page (358 lines)
- `style.css` – styles, including light/dark mode handling
- `script.js` – JavaScript that powers the theme toggle and profile slider
- Image assets: `images/`, `logo_*.png`, `aria*.png`, `a1_*` etc.
- Meta files: `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `CNAME`, favicons

## Embedded character data schema

The landing page defines an array of character objects under the `<script id="profilesData" type="application/json">` tag. Each object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Lia",
  "age": 20,
  "details": "I am an aspiring science fiction writer. I love Star Trek (TNG).",
  "images": ["profile1-1.jpg", "profile1-2.jpg", ...]
}
```

`script.js` reads this array to render the interactive profile cards.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the dating app live?**  
A: Not yet. We are in the pre-launch phase collecting early sign-ups.

**Q: How do I become an AIKAI VIP?**  
A: Submit your email through the wait-list form on the landing page. Early supporters receive lifetime VIP status once the app launches.
