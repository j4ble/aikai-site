# AIKAI

> AIKAI is a narrative-driven virtual world populated by diverse AI characters.

## Embedded character data schema

The landing page defines an array of 18 character objects under the `<script id="profilesData" type="application/json">` tag. Each object has the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Lia",
  "age": 20,
  "details": "I am an aspiring science fiction writer. I love Star Trek (TNG).",
  "images": ["profile1-1.jpg", "profile1-2.jpg", "profile1-3.jpg", "profile1-4.jpg"]
}
```

`minified.js` reads this array to render the interactive profile cards with image navigation.
