A cheerful woman with medium-length brown hair and a warm smile is working on a clay pot at a pottery wheel in a rustic workshop. She is wearing a red t-shirt under blue overalls with a paint-splattered look, suggesting she's been working with clay. The background features wooden shelves filled with clay pots, and a window with greenery outside, allowing natural light to fill the space. The atmosphere is lively and creative, with the woman's expressive face and the earthy textures of the pottery adding to the scene's charm.
