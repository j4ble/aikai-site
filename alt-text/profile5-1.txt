A confident, dark-skinned woman with short white hair and glasses paints a canvas in a bright room. She wears a teal jacket with colorful splatters, a yellow shirt, and a red bow tie. She holds a paintbrush in her right hand and a palette in her left. The background shows a window letting in light, a paintbrush holder, and another canvas. The style is vibrant and detailed.
